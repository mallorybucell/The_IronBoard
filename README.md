# The_IronBoard

Group project working with 2 other backend engineers and a front-end engineer to build a scoreboard to be used during IronYard cohort gaming sessions.

We worked well together building out a data model, discussing how data would be passed, and creating a working API for the front-end to call.

Most recent commit is not currently functional- mostly because this was a lesson in learning when to 'git add ., vs git add -A'.
